Lesson 6
========================================================


### Scatterplot Review
Create a scatterplot of price (y) vs carat weight (x)
Limit the x-axis and y-axis to omit the top 1% of values
```{r Scatterplot Review}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
ggplot(aes(x=carat, y=price), data=diamonds) + geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$carat, .99)), ylim = c(0, quantile(diamonds$price, .99)))
```
We can see a non linear relationship, maybe it's exponential or maybe it's something else. We can see that the dispersion, or variance also increases as the carat size increases.   
We can see that the liear trend line doesn't go through the centre of the data at some key places. If we tried to use this to make predictions then we might be off for some key places.

### Frances Gerety
Notes:
Large supply of diamonds forund in South Africa in 1870. Up until then the supply of diamonds was quite low. The De Beer a=Cartel controlled the prices in the international diamond market. World war 1 and the great depression saw diamond sales plummet. In 1938 the De Beer cartel inquired about using propagande to boost the sales of diamonds.

### ggpairs Function
Notes:
GGPairs plots each variable against every other variable pair wise. 
```{r ggpairs Function}
# install these if necessary
install.packages('GGally') #for matrix plot
install.packages('scales')
install.packages('memisc') #summarise the regression
install.packages('lattice') #
install.packages('MASS')
install.packages('car') # to recode variables
install.packages('reshape') #reshape & wrangle data
install.packages('plyr')

# load the ggplot graphics package and the others
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(memisc)

# sample 10,000 diamonds from the data set
set.seed(20022012)
diamond_samp <- diamonds[sample(1:length(diamonds$price), 10000), ]
ggpairs(diamond_samp,
        axisLabels = 'internal',
  lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", shape = I('.'))),
  upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I('.'))))
```
in the lower triangle of the plot matrix GGPairs uses grouped histograms for qualitative - qualitative pairs and scatter plots for quantitative -quantitaive pairs. In the upper triangle it plots grouped histograms for qualitative - qualitative pairs, this time using the x instead of the y as the grouping factor. Box plots for qualitative - quantitaive pairs and it provides the correlation for quantitative - quantitaive pairs.

### Scatterplot Transformation

```{r Scatterplot Transformation}

```


### Create a new function to transform the carat variable

```{r cuberoot transformation}
cuberoot_trans = function() trans_new('cuberoot', transform = function(x) x^(1/3),
                                      inverse = function(x) x^3)
```

#### Use the cuberoot_trans function
```{r Use cuberoot_trans}
ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')
```

```{r Overplotting Revisited}
ggplot(aes(carat, price), data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
                     breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = log10_trans(), limits = c(350, 15000),
                     breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +
  ggtitle('Price (log10) by Cube-Root of Carat')

### Price vs. Carat and Clarity

Alter the code below.
```{r Price vs. Carat and Clarity}
# install and load the RColorBrewer package
install.packages('RColorBrewer')

  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1, position = 'jitter') +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div',
    guide = guide_legend(title = 'Clarity', reverse = T,
    override.aes = list(alpha = 1, size = 2))) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = cuberoot_trans(), limits = c(0.2, 3),
    breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)) +

    breaks = c(350, 1000, 5000, 10000, 15000)) +

### Building the Linear Model
Notes:

```{r Building the Linear Model}
m1 <- lm(I(log(price)) ~ I(carat^(1/3)), data = diamonds)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + carat)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + cut)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + color)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + clarity)
mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5)
```

Notice how adding cut to our model does not help explain much of the variance
in the price of diamonds. This fits with out exploration earlier.

### Model Problems

Research:
(Take some time to come up with 2-4 problems for the model)

```{r A Bigger, Better Data Set}
install.package('bitops')
install.packages('RCurl')
library('bitops')
library('RCurl')

diamondsurl = getBinaryURL("https://raw.github.com/solomonm/diamonds-data/master/BigDiamonds.Rda")
load(rawConnection(diamondsurl))
```

## Predictions

Example Diamond from BlueNile:
Round 1.00 Very Good I VS1 $5,601

```{r}
#Be sure youâ€™ve loaded the library memisc and have m5 saved as an object in your workspace.
thisDiamond = data.frame(carat = 1.00, cut = "V.Good",
                         color = "I", clarity="VS1")
modelEstimate = predict(m5, newdata = thisDiamond,
                        interval="prediction", level = .95)
```

Evaluate how well the model predicts the BlueNile diamond's price. Think about the fitted point estimate as well as the 95% CI.
